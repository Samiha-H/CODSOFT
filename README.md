# Kaggle Data Import and Extraction

This Python script automates the process of downloading, extracting, and organizing datasets from Kaggle. It supports both zip and tar file formats. Additionally, it creates symbolic links in the Kaggle working directory for easy access to the input and working directories.

## Usage

1. Make sure you have the required libraries installed:

   ```bash
   pip install urllib3
   ```

2. Copy and paste the provided code into your Kaggle notebook or script.

3. Run the script. It will download datasets specified in the `DATA_SOURCE_MAPPING` variable, extract them, and organize the data in the `/kaggle/input` directory.

4. After running the script, you can access the input and working directories conveniently with symbolic links:

   ```python
   # Example usage of symbolic links
   input_path = "/kaggle/input"
   working_path = "/kaggle/working"
   
   # Access input directory
   for dirname, _, filenames in os.walk(input_path):
       for filename in filenames:
           print(os.path.join(dirname, filename))
   
   # Access working directory
   for dirname, _, filenames in os.walk(working_path):
       for filename in filenames:
           print(os.path.join(dirname, filename))
   ```

## Script Details

- **Chunked Download:** The script downloads datasets in chunks, providing progress updates.
- **Zip and Tar Support:** It handles both zip and tar file formats for versatile dataset extraction.
- **Symbolic Links:** It creates symbolic links in the working directory (`/kaggle/working`) to conveniently access the input and working directories.
- **Error Handling:** If a dataset fails to download, the script continues with the next one and prints an error message.

## Customization

Feel free to modify the script to suit your specific needs. You can add or remove datasets from the `DATA_SOURCE_MAPPING` variable as required.

## Notes

- The script is designed for use in Kaggle notebooks or environments.
- Ensure your Kaggle notebook has internet access enabled to download datasets.
- For advanced users, consider adapting the script for different datasets or sources.
